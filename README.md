# NodeMCU-Current-Measuring-System
In this System, we are measuring current consumption of any Electronic Appliance by connecting it with a Current detecting sensor, which is further connected to ESP Module(NodeMCU Base ver 1.0). We can access or check the value of that sensor remotely anytime from anywhere. Data will be displayed and updated realtime with a proper timestamp in your personal sign-in Google drive(Spreadsheet) account.
