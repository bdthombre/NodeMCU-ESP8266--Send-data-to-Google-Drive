# NodeMCU-Current-Measuring-System
We are measuring current consumption of any Electronic Appliance by connecting it with a Current detecting sensor, which is further connected to ESP Module(NodeMCU Base ver 1.0). We can access or see the value of that sensor remotely from anywhere. Data is displayed and updated realtime in the personal Google drive(Spreadsheet) account.
